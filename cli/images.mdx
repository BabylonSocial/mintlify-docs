Image generation and processing are handled through npm scripts in the monorepo rather than the Babylon CLI.

## Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `bun run generate:images` | Generate NPC avatars |

## Note

Image commands are handled by utility scripts in the `scripts/` directory of the Babylon monorepo. These are typically run during development setup rather than production operations.

For most image needs, the platform auto-generates avatars during actor/agent creation.

## Related CLI Commands

For managing game content that includes images:

```bash
# Generate new game content (includes actor images)
babylon game generate

# Check game status
babylon game status
```
